# foodviewparse

I've been using FoodView on android to document my food intake. The app is very basic and a bit crap. However it doesn't require a login or spam you with adverts which is a bonus.

I'm not yet sure what I expect to do with the data here.

I suspect I will write my own app to do the same work as foodview but with a few improvements that suit me.
